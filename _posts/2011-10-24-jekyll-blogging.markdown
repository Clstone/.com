Jekyll blogging might be more complicated than
other approaches but it also offers high
flexibility and many features.

You can install it yourself with:

    gem install jekyll

#### Note

OSX users might need to update their RubyGems:

    sudo gem update -system

Additionally there are many other options:

  * Using `rdiscount` or `maruku`
  * Using `pygments` for syntax highlighting
  * and this list could go on and on due to an amazing community support

For more information check the [Jekyll Wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki)
