Here I am going to post links to different Physics related things I worked on. (Mainly proves and explanations) Just cause I love Physics and want to share.

**I was lucky to have a great teacher who tought me almost all of this. **

BTW: I called this page Scientia because I took 4 years of latin and feel like i need to use it somewhere.
