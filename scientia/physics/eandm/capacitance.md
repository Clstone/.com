Capacitance is the ability of a Capacitor to store charge.

## Capacitor

A Capacitor is an electrical component that can store energy in an electric field. They consist at least of two electrical conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator), although many variations can be found.

A potential voltage difference between the two fields will create a static electri field develops across the dielectric. Positive charge will collect on one of the plates and negative charge on the other one.



## Charge

`\[
q = C * V
\]`

the charge stored equals to the Capacitance of the object and the Voltage across the object.

## Energy

To derive an expression for how much energy is stored in a capacitor we consider the infinitesimal small voltage due to the infinitesimal little charge `\(y\)`

`\[
C * dV = dq
\]`

Energy is defined as:

`\[
E = q * V
\]`

The Energy for every small amount of voltage can therefore be expressed as:

`\[
dE = q * dV
\]`

At this point we can take our Capacitance expression and plug it in.

`\[
dE = q  /frac{dq}{C}
\]`

Then we can add all these infinitesimal small Energies up to get the total amount of energy:

`\[
\int dE = \int q  \frac{dq}{C}
\]`

`\[
E = \frac{1}{2}  \frac{q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(C V)^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]`

## Capacitance

The Capacitance between two plates can be derived as followed

### Electric Field

The Electric Field between two plates:

`\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{q}{A} \frac{1}{\epsilon}
\]`

### Voltage

The Voltage between two plates:

`\[
V = E * d = \frac{d * q}{A\epsilon_0}
\]`

`\[
q = CV
\]`

`\[
C = \frac{q}{V} = \frac{A \epsilon_0}{d*q} q = \frac{A \epsilon_0}{d}
\]`

The Capacitance between two plates:

`\[
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
\]`
