Here I am going to post links to different Physics related things I worked on. (Mainly proves and explanations) Just cause I love Physics and want to share.

BTW: I called this page Scientia because I took 4 years of latin and feel like i need to use it somewhere.

    Note: links in paranthesis are external ones
